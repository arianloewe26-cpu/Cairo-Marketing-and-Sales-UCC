# About
We are a team of 15 IT experts, all between 28 and 30 years old, with five years of experience in the industry. We created Cairo because, during our studies, we were often frustrated by the unstructured nature of other management software, the constant need to switch between programs, and the fact that some programs didn't even work properly. This is something we still encounter in our professional lives, and we wanted to change it. Our improvements, therefore, come from those directly affected. We understand the problems, we can solve them, we have solved them, and we will continue to work on improvements.
